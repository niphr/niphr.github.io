<p>Hi, I´m Adam, a software engineer, and my current interests, which will be reflected in the blog articles, include information security, privacy and general self-improvement. The name is a pseudonym, of course. Maybe the years in infosec have taken their toll, but I don´t get the modern disposition to divulge personal information on the internet.</p>
