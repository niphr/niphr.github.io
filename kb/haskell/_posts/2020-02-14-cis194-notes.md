Course: [Introduction to Haskell](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)

## Week 1: Introduction to Haskell

* "wholemeal programming" - thinking of general solutions instead of single examples (map over a whole list, think of a whole graph instead of a single path)
* boolean logic: `&& || not == /=`

### Homework

#### Environment setup
* vscode
* intero (stack build intero)
* Haskero (vscode extension)
* hlint (stack build hlint + vscode extension)
* hindent (stack install hindent) 
* stylish-haskell (stack install stylish-haskell) 
* Haskell Code Formatter (vscode extension) - ctrl+shift+I to format file

Solution: [GitHub](https://github.com/niphr/cis194-solutions/blob/master/src/hw1.hs)

## Week 2: Algebraic Data Types

* custom enumeration types `data Thing = Shoe | Ship deriving Show`
* data and type constructor names must start with capital letter, variables must start with lowercase
* pattern matching
  * `x@pat` matches pattern pat and binds it to x

### Homework

* stack/Haskell package structure: path must match - ex.: if file is HW2/LogAnalysis.hs, it should start with `module HW2.LogAnalysis` and import from the same folder should look like this `import HW2.Log`
* useful functions:
  * words, unwords (String <-> [String])
  * read (specify type if needed (`read "1" :: Int`), but if ghc can figure the type out (eg. from signature), it might not be needed)
  * lines
  * foldr (f acc xs), preferred type of fold (alternative in some cases could be foldl')

Solution: [GitHub](https://github.com/niphr/cis194-solutions/blob/master/src/LogAnalysis.hs)

## Week 3: Recursion Patterns, Polymorphism and the Prelude
* declaring polymorphic type: `data List t = E | C t (List t)`
  * `t` is a type variable, needs to start with lowercase
* polymorphic function has to be able to handle all possible types
* `data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a`
* partial (only handle some inputs, e.g. head crashes on []) vs. total functions
  * in general, avoid partial functions (head, tail, !!,...)
  * instead use pattern matching, Maybe,...

### Homework

Solution: [GitHub](https://github.com/niphr/cis194-solutions/blob/master/src/Golf.hs)

## Week 4: Higher-order Programming and Type Inference

* operator section: (?y) is equivalent to (\x y -> x ? y), where ? is an operator (e.g. >, ==)
  * (y?) is equivalent to (\x y -> y ? x)
* function composition (.)
* currying, partial application
* curry, uncurry
* point-free style - only if it improves readability
* folds

### Homework

* set difference function `\\` `(import Data.List, [1, 2, 3] \\ [1] == [2, 3])`

Solution: [GitHub](https://github.com/niphr/cis194-solutions/blob/master/src/week4.hs)

## Week 5: More Polymorphism and Type Classes

* standard type classes: Eq, Ord, Num, Show, Read, Integral
* to be an instance of the type class, type (e.g. Int) must implement all methods required by type class (e.g. (+), (-),...)
  * either (==) or (/=) should be enough to define equality, the other is just the opposite
* creating own type classes: `class MyName a where`
  * and an instance `instance MyName Int where`

### Homework

* maybe (unpacking Maybe values)

Solution: [GitHub](https://github.com/niphr/cis194-solutions/blob/master/src/Calc.hs)

## Week 6: Lazy Evaluation

* strict evaluation: arguments are fully evaluated before passing them to the function (even if the function ignores them)
  * easier to reason about (e.g. performance-wise)
  * makes sense if argument-evaluation involves side effects
* lazy evaluation: expression is evaluated only when needed
  * until the value is needed, argument is passed as an unevaluated expression (thunk)
  * unused thunks are garbage-collected
  * what does "when needed" mean:
    * when the expression is pattern-matched
    * evaluation proceeds only as far as necessary, e.g. head [1+2, 5] will return (1+2) and not evaluate the inner expression
* consequences of lazy evaluation
  * purity
  * tricky to reason about space usage - large thunk may lead to stack overflow before it would be evaluated
  * short-circuiting operators
  * infinite data structures

### Homework

* iterate
