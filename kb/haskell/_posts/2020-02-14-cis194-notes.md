## Week 1: Introduction to Haskell

* "wholemeal programming" - thinking of general solutions instead of single examples (map over a whole list, think of a whole graph instead of a single path)
* boolean logic: `&& || not == /=`

### Homework

#### Environment setup
* vscode
* intero (stack build intero)
* Haskero (vscode extension)
* hlint (stack build hlint + vscode extension)
* hindent (stack install hindent) 
* stylish-haskell (stack install stylish-haskell) 
* Haskell Code Formatter (vscode extension) - ctrl+shift+I to format file
