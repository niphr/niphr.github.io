Course: [Introduction to Haskell](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)

## Week 1: Introduction to Haskell

* "wholemeal programming" - thinking of general solutions instead of single examples (map over a whole list, think of a whole graph instead of a single path)
* boolean logic: `&& || not == /=`

### Homework

#### Environment setup
* vscode
* intero (stack build intero)
* Haskero (vscode extension)
* hlint (stack build hlint + vscode extension)
* hindent (stack install hindent) 
* stylish-haskell (stack install stylish-haskell) 
* Haskell Code Formatter (vscode extension) - ctrl+shift+I to format file

Solution: [GitHub](https://github.com/niphr/cis194-solutions/blob/master/src/hw1.hs)

## Week 2: Algebraic Data Types

* custom enumeration types `data Thing = Shoe | Ship deriving Show`
* data and type constructor names must start with capital letter, variables must start with lowercase
* pattern matching
  * `x@pat` matches pattern pat and binds it to x

### Homework

* stack/Haskell package structure: path must match - ex.: if file is HW2/LogAnalysis.hs, it should start with `module HW2.LogAnalysis` and import from the same folder should look like this `import HW2.Log`
* useful functions:
  * words, unwords (String <-> [String])
  * read (specify type if needed (read "1" :: Int), but if ghc can figure the type out (eg. from signature), it might not be needed)
  * lines
  * foldr (f acc xs), preferred type of fold (alternative in some cases could be foldl')

## Week 3: Recursion Patterns, Polymorphism and the Prelude
