title: "Why do I blog"

After considering it for many months, I recently decided to start a blog. This first post explains my motivation.
The nudge to push me over the edge was a quote from Arthur Schopenhauer´s essay *On Reading and Books*:

> When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. In learning to write, the pupil goes over with his pen what the teacher has outlined in pencil: so in reading; the greater part of the work of thought is already done for us. This is why it relieves us to take up a book after being occupied with our own thoughts. And in reading, the mind is, in fact, only the playground of another’s thoughts. So it comes about that if anyone spends almost the whole day in reading, and by way of relaxation devotes the intervals to some thoughtless pastime, he gradually loses the capacity for thinking; just as the man who always rides, at last forgets how to walk. This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid.

As a voracious reader, this passage hit close to home. I often have a feeling that I only retain a very small portion of all I read. That might be fine for novels - forgetting dull sections or even whole books is more of a blessing than a curse. But I have also rushed through much heavier technical books. For these, reading through only once is clearly insufficient to absorb the knowledge.

I do not expect anyone else to read this blog. Its main purpose is to be a canvas on which I write about any topic I happen to focus on at the moment. The very act of writing should show me how much I do not know about the topic - to shatter the comfortable delusion that I *understand* anything without having practiced it.
